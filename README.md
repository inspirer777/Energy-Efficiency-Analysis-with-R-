# Energy Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes the energy efficiency of buildings using regression and statistical methods. The dataset includes 768 samples with 8 attributes, aiming to predict heating and cooling loads.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency)
- **Attributes**:
  - X1: Relative Compactness
  - X2: Surface Area
  - X3: Wall Area
  - X4: Roof Area
  - X5: Overall Height
  - X6: Orientation
  - X7: Glazing Area
  - y: Heating or Cooling Load

## Analysis
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Correlation analysis
  - Multiple linear regression
  - Diagnostic plots
  - Transformations (Box-Cox, inverse residual plots)
- **Software**: R
